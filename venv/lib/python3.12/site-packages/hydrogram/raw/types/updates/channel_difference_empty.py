    Constructor of :obj:`~hydrogram.raw.base.updates.ChannelDifference`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``181``
        - ID: ``3E11AFFB``

    Parameters:
        pts (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            The latest PTS

        final (``bool``, *optional*):
            Whether there are more updates that must be fetched (always false)

        timeout (``int`` ``32-bit``, *optional*):
            Clients are supposed to refetch the channel difference after timeout seconds have elapsed

    Functions:
        This object can be returned by 1 function.
