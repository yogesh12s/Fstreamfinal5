class ReplyKeyboardForceReply(TLObject):  # type: ignore
    """Force the user to send a reply

    Constructor of :obj:`~hydrogram.raw.base.ReplyMarkup`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``181``
        - ID: ``86B40B08``

    Parameters:
        single_use (``bool``, *optional*):
            Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat – the user can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again.

        selective (``bool``, *optional*):
            Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message. Example: A user requests to change the bot's language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language. Other users in the group don't see the keyboard.

        placeholder (``str``, *optional*):
            The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the keyboard is active; 1-64 characters.
