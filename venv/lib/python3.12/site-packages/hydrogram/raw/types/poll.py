    Constructor of :obj:`~hydrogram.raw.base.Poll`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``181``
        - ID: ``58747131``

    Parameters:
        id (``int`` ``64-bit``):
            ID of the poll

        question (:obj:`TextWithEntities <hydrogram.raw.base.TextWithEntities>`):
            The question of the poll

        answers (List of :obj:`PollAnswer <hydrogram.raw.base.PollAnswer>`):
            The possible answers, vote using messages.sendVote.

        closed (``bool``, *optional*):
            Whether the poll is closed and doesn't accept any more answers

        public_voters (``bool``, *optional*):
            Whether cast votes are publicly visible to all users (non-anonymous poll)

        multiple_choice (``bool``, *optional*):
            Whether multiple options can be chosen as answer

        quiz (``bool``, *optional*):
            Whether this is a quiz (with wrong and correct answers, results shown in the return type)

        close_period (``int`` ``32-bit``, *optional*):
            Amount of time in seconds the poll will be active after creation, 5-600. Can't be used together with close_date.

        close_date (``int`` ``32-bit``, *optional*):
            Point in time (Unix timestamp) when the poll will be automatically closed. Must be at least 5 and no more than 600 seconds in the future; can't be used together with close_period.
