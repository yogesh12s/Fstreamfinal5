    Details:
        - Layer: ``181``
        - ID: ``91CD32A8``

    Parameters:
        user_id (:obj:`InputUser <hydrogram.raw.base.InputUser>`):
            User ID

        offset (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Number of list elements to be skipped

        max_id (``int`` ``64-bit``):
            If a positive value was transferred, the method will return only photos with IDs less than the set one. This parameter is often useful when refetching file references », as in conjuction with limit=1 and offset=-1 the photo object with the id specified in max_id can be fetched.

        limit (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Number of list elements to be returned

    Returns:
        :obj:`photos.Photos <hydrogram.raw.base.photos.Photos>`
