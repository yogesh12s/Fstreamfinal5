class GetAdminedPublicChannels(TLObject):  # type: ignore
    """Get channels/supergroups/geogroups we're admin in. Usually called when the user exceeds the limit for owned public channels/supergroups/geogroups, and the user is given the choice to remove one of his channels/supergroups/geogroups.


    Details:
        - Layer: ``181``
        - ID: ``F8B036AF``

    Parameters:
        by_location (``bool``, *optional*):
            Get geogroups

        check_limit (``bool``, *optional*):
            If set and the user has reached the limit of owned public channels/supergroups/geogroups, instead of returning the channel list one of the specified errors will be returned.Useful to check if a new public channel can indeed be created, even before asking the user to enter a channel username to use in channels.checkUsername/channels.updateUsername.

        for_personal (``bool``, *optional*):
